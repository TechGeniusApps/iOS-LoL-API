# iOS LoL API

Objective-C client for retrieving data from "League of Legends" API. All available web services exposed by the official League of Legends API are available allowing developers easy access without hassle. This client even has offline access to whatever data once it has accessed it at least once successfully. Also has an option to store images offline too (but will take up alot of space). This is handy for your rate limit exceeded (429) or service unavailable (503) or user simply offline.
